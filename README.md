# Liri App

### A command line node app which takes in parameters and returns data from either Twitter, Spotify, or OMDB.

#### The app takes in 5 possible parameters, **"my-tweets"**, **"spotify-this-song"**, **"movie-this"**, **"do-what-it-says"**, or **"erase-log"**.
#### Run the app by entering "node-liri" followed by one of the above parameters on the command line.
#### The app uses account specific Twitter and Spotify API keys which must be stored in a .env file, and are being accessed by the keys.js file via the dotenv module.  To run this app, you must supply your own API keys in a .env file. The .env file should appear as so:
###### SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
###### SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
###### TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
###### TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
###### TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
###### TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret

#### Once the .env file is in the same directory as liri.js and contains the necessary API keys, the commands below can be entered.  All results of the search commands are saved in a separate log.txt file.

## Commands:

* **node liri my-tweets**

  * Returns the tweets, up to 20, of the twitter account which belongs to the specified API key.

* **node liri spotify-this-song (song name)**

  * Returns information for first 5 Spotify results for song entered.

* **node liri movie-this (movie name)**

  * Returns information for movie entered from OMDB.

* **node liri do-what-it-says**

  * This command will take in parameters specified in the random.txt file. These parameters can be changed to any of the available 5.

* **node liri erase-log**

  * Displays a confirmation message to erase "log.txt" file.  If yes, clears file and displays success message in console.

#### Additionally, "node http.js" can be ran to start a node server on port 8080. Start the server and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to view current state of log.txt.  Currently any changes to log.txt can only be viewed by refreshing the page.
